DEPRECATED: See akatrevorjay/pyzfscore for where the current work lies, a rewrite in CFFI.

This is pyzfs from pyzfs.sf.net patched (poorly) for ZFS on Linux support.

This is my first foray into SWIG and Python C/C++ bindings, so be nice ;)

Plan is to extend this since the interface given is rather horrid. Help is welcome!
